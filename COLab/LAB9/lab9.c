/*
This example program sounds the bell when driver is on seat 
AND haven't closed the doors. Use the general framework and the function 
shells, replace the code inside  the control_action() function with your 
own code.

Note: This code is designed to run in an infinite loop to mimic a real control system. 
If you prefer to read the inputs from a file, modify the code appropriately to terminate the
loop when all the inputs have been processed.

run this file as : gcc filename.c -o executableName
